Hello, my name is Luke. I am a third-year student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am studying philosophy and history. I am interested in aesthetics and philosophy of art, broadly. More specifically, I love learning about philosophy of film and literature, literary theory, film theory, memory, ego, illusion, chance, and coincidence.

Recently, I have done work on digital art and authenticity, using work by Linda Hutcheon and Gilles Deleuze to look into whether the digitization of art, both born-digital and physical-turned-digital,Â  carries the same essence and humanity that we see in traditional forms of art like painting or literature.

In the time where I am not forced by society's pressure on my brain to create things for my academic career, I love to watch movies (specifically going to the movie theater), reading (only gay classic fiction), and talking to myself. I'm trying desperately hard to think if there is anything else beyond this sad attempt at humor that describes me, but I think I'm out. I also have an unrelated obsession with wind and circles.
